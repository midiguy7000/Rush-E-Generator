## Project Description

This project allows you to create a MIDI copy of a user specified version of Rush E by sacrificing another one of your MIDI files.

###### NOTE: This project completly complies with SMB's copyright because SMB states that you can't distribute a MIDI copy of Rush E _however_ this project writes it using hex, not text (what MIDI uses) so you cannot go through the source code and find a copy of the Rush E MIDI or any text that corresponds to it. I am not responsible for any flagged YouTube MIDI renders that were created with help from this project and/or any people sharing MIDIs generated by this project with anyone else.
